> Wadi rum was one of the best trips I have ever been on. I went with the whole Grade 8 and I got to sleep in a cabin with my best friend. We took jeeps, ran down sand hills, had midnight conversations, and just experienced being free of technology for a night. Yes the cabin was small and ugly, but it made memories that will last a lifetime. I was able to capture this photo on my 10+ year old camera that belonged to my mom. I took it on a bumpy moving jeep.

>One of my main goals in life is to visit the Northern lights. Ever since I watched the Polar Express, one of my favourite movies, the Northern lights have been glued to the back of head.
